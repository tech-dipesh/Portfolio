        <h2>This page is for sharing my personal life and thoughts. If you don’t like it, feel free to leave.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Laptop:</strong> I recently bought an Acer ALG 15G laptop for around 50k INR (80k NPR). I give 100% credit to my family for this, as we don’t come from a background where we can afford everything easily. The entire amount was borrowed, and my family trusts me completely to repay the debt through my hard work and future success—a responsibility I will fulfill without fail. The laptop has great specifications: Acer ALG 15G H Series, RAM: 16GB, ROM: 512GB. It helps me multitask in daily tasks, though its charging capacity is a bit of an issue.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> I use a Nokia 1.4, a 2020 model my father bought in 2021. Before this, I never owned a mobile phone and never asked my family for one, knowing how costly it is for us to manage household expenses. This phone sometimes lags, but I’m comfortable with it because I only need it to stay connected with my family and close relatives. Its specifications are modest—3GB RAM and 64GB ROM—but it serves my purpose well.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            My main priorities are currently:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning Backend development, deployment, and DevOps.</li>
                <li>Freelancing.</li>
                <li>Studying with the target of achieving above-average marks, as I aim to get a scholarship from any external or university source.</li>
                <li>Contributing a lot to GitHub open source projects.</li>
                <li>Learning the basics of DSA. I don't need to specialize in it but need to understand it well enough to crack interviews that aren't heavily DSA-based.</li>
                <li>Preparing for upcoming LinkedIn opportunities, as I receive them on a weekly basis and need to be proficient in industry-level skills.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
